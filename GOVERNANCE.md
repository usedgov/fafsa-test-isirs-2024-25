# Governance
The goal of this project is to accelerate the successful processing of Institutional Student Information Records (ISIRs) for the 2024-25 FAFSA Award Year by our partners in higher education. We aim to do that by providing **test data** and **test tools** that support implementation of the official ISIR Specification. (See [Draft 2024-25 FAFSA Specifications Guide, December 2023 Update #2](https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/handbooks-manuals-or-guides/2023-05-31/draft-2024-25-fafsa-specifications-guide-december-2023-update-2), *Volume 4 â€“ Record Layouts and Processing Codes*)

Any contributions of test data or to the test tools will be reviewed especially for their accuracy and correctness. Please **do not use real personally identifiable information (PII)**, as your pull request may be rejected. Submitted test ISIRs will go through light validation and review, and may by modified before being publicly posted.

This project is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
